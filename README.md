# Linux Command Handler
## Created with Python 3 and urwid (https://urwid.org)

This is a simple terminal-based application to manage Linux commands, on any Linux host.

You can run, add, update, remove any Linux command from a sqlite database.
The application also can handle uploading a file with the list of commands
into the dabase, or download all commands from database.


### Requirement:
urwid package needed to be installed by<br>
```shell
$ pip install urwid
```

Simply copy app.py into a directory(preferably, an empty one) and then let the application run by: <br>
```shell
$ python3 app.py
```
